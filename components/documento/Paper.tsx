        Next generation of computer vision for plant disease monitoring in
        precision agriculture: A contemporary survey, taxonomy, experiments,
        and future direction
      </h1>
      <p className="text-xl font-mono">
        Efficient and rational monitoring of plant health is an essential
        prerequisite for ensuring optimal crop production and resource
        management in the field of agriculture. Computer vision techniques have
        revolutionized visual disease monitoring with their exceptional visual
        recognition performance. However, despite the outstanding results, the
        widespread acceptance of these methods in agriculture practice is still
        in its early stages. This study presents a comprehensive survey of the
        next generation of computer vision models applied to plant disease
        monitoring in precision agriculture. Our study begins by tracing the
        evolution of agricultural computer vision research over the past decade,
        encompassing legacy methods such as convolutional neural networks
        (CNNs), progressing to newer techniques like vision transformers
        (ViTs), and culminating in cutting-edge vision multi-layer perceptrons
        (MLPs). Next, our study embraces both qualitative and quantitative
        approaches, supporting a profound review of literature and classifying
        methodologies and experimental approaches. A significant contribution
        lies in our comprehensive taxonomy, offering a fine-grained
        categorization of current computer vision models.
